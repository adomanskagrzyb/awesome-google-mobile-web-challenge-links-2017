# Contribution Guidelines

Awesome lists are a curation, not a collection. We want to make it easier for students to find additional learning resources in the context of this scholarship. Quality matters and not quantity.This is why we can't accept every submission. However, we're always open for feedback to ensure a certain level awesomeness :wink:

but **what is awesome ?**

## Awesome = Community

Here are some things what we consider as an awesome resource:

- highly recommend by other contributors or fellow students
- hard to find for various reasons
- helpful if you struggle with a concept by a different way of teaching 
- you wish you had known this resource when you started taking this course

Since the selection process is community-driven, you'll get GitHub reactions from others for your submission. This gives you way to find out if you're on the right track.
