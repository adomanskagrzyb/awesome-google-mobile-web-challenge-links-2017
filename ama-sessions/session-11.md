#### Are the non accepted people allowed to be part of this community (Slack/Forum) if they pay to continue, or will be treated separately?
This Slack and Forums will be closed one month after Phase 1 ends, but don’t worry – we will do our best to make sure the community “survives”

#### How does the select process work? and how would we now we’ve been selected?
The Phase 2 selection criteria are explained in Scholarship’s Google Site: https://sites.google.com/knowlabs.com/udacitydevscholars17/home1. You will receive an email on February 14 informing you whether you have received the Nanodegree scholarship or not. Fingers crossed!

#### To what extent will our GitHub/Linkedin accounts be part of our evaluation? I mean, are there any metrics used for them, or minimum requirements to be considered accepted?
Not sure if I understood your question correctly, but GitHub/Linkedin accounts are not part of Phase 2 selection criteria, if that’s what you are asking?

#### Can we assume that if every section of the course is showing as completed everything is done and we can relax? Some people said that it was possible to skip some quizzes, and the section would still show as completed. (And were afraid that they might not even be considered for the next phase)
Excellent question! In order to achieve 100% completion rate of the course, you need to have 1) classroom status on 100% viewed 2) all lessons completed 3) all quizzes submitted. And yes, as a matter of fast, the lesson might look like completed even if you did not submit all the quizzes. So we always recommend students to double-check if everything is there :slightly_smiling_face: We will be sending a newsletter later today with all these criteria listed.

#### If anybody does not won’t to participate in Phase 2 but gets selected: Is there something like a waitlist and the next student gets a place or should he contact the support earlier?
Yes, there will be a waitlist!

#### 1. will everyone be notified when accepted or rejected for Phase 2? 2. can we apply to the challenge again later on? If yes, when is the next one planned and how to find the application forms? 3. where can we find the list of coming Udacity schorlarship programs?
1) yes, everyone will receive an email on Feb 14 informing him/her whether s/he was granted a scholarship or not. We keep our fingers crossed! 
2) and 
3) Yes, you can definitely apply for any other scholarship you want. Even if it takes place at the same time. You can find all the scholarships offered by Udacity here: https://www.udacity.com/scholarships1. For example, this one starts pretty soon: https://www.udacity.com/bertelsmann-data-scholarships1 

#### I have just heard about Bertelsmann’s Data Science Scholarship Program. If I will be accepted to phase 2 here and then this Bertelsmann’s program. Is it possible to be enrolled these different scholarship programs as they are supported not only by different companies but also they are of different subjects/paths. I believe it will ve impossible to finish MWS just before Bertelsmann’s begins. Will I have to prefer one of them? or, maybe, Will Udacity even reject my application to Bertelsmann’s right away because I am enrolled to another one?
Yes, you can be enrolled in both at the same time, although I’d recommend you to think twice whether you want to do that. I’d be careful with enrolling if you are not 100% sure you cannot dedicate enough time to it (Bertelsmann’s begins on May 08, 2018 and Google Dev scholarship is over in August…). Otherwise you make take away the opportunity for getting a scholarship from some other student. Lets always be mindful guys!

#### For phase 2: are there any privileges for those who will finish it first, or finish it in certain shorter time?
no, it does not matter if you finish in 3 months or 6 months. As long as you finish.

#### I finished the course lately because I have a full-time job and I didn’t have time to study with a buddy because I wanted to finish the lessons before, this will negatively affect my evaluation?
Participation in #new_study_buddies initiative is not mandatory and will not effect your evaluation, however might affect what you learn here, which is more important, right?

#### Will someone that gets accepted to the phase 2 For say in Front End course be able to transfer him/her self to the Mobile Web Specialist and vice versa if they think the course is TOO easy/ TOO hard.
We understand it might happen, however we are not able to move students between tracks.

#### What can we do if our study buddy has mistakenly reported that we have not met when the donut robot asked? How can we fix this?
It’s not a problem, don’t worry, it will not affect your evaluation. we all do mistakes sometimes

#### Are Slack and the forum going to be available in the period between the end of this phase (6th of February) and announcement of the accepted students ? and how can we reach you in case of any concern or issue after 6th of February?
The classroom, as well as Slack and Forums will stay available for one month after February 6th! :tada:

#### Most of the new posts on the forums involve out of scope topics to the target of the challenge course as far as I believe. Is it still going to be considered whether I interact or not in the next period even though that interaction won’t be really helping the people that are still working on the course? I am waiting for people with genuine questions on the course material to reach out, but still I only get out of scope questions or trivia which is discouraging me from opening the forum.
no, your forum activity in Nanodegree will not affect your final grade. It will be still very important for us to foster the community spirit though, we will just find different ways this time
